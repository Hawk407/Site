You have been my light ever since you came into my life and I can never thank heavens enough for it. This is your special day and I, as the good husband I am, prepared my HEAVENLY wife...

                        I would advise not to open this gift before exploring the first page. This is something a bit more... special. A dessert if you will. This is something I designed to melt you. Well I took inspirations around for coding this but the idea was mine, yes. Either way, back to first page Bebe if you haven't explored it. However if you have, please click on the Beware! button below. And as the it says, brace yourselves for whatever comes your way...

        <h2>Happy Birthday Yashitae</h2>
        <p>I don't know how more can I express this. I have said it a thousand times and I will say it a million more. I.Love. You. I know this isn't supposed to be a love letter but I just can never stop appreciating, praising or worshipping you. <br><br>I would be lying if I said I sure with everything about you first hand. It surely was a gamble. A gamble on fate, on feelings, on a certain trust and belief that "No, if it is anyone, it's this person right here". I never knew what fueled this so much for today. Was it the hair look that I saw you in, in front of the gymkhana? Or was it the "Love" necklace you gave me to hold on to? Was it the constant hints with the footsies we played in the class or the endless time we spend together unraveling each other on Discord? It could have been the quiet moments that arose with me when we used to walk together and I used to be silent as a mute. Or perhaps it was the feeling I had when I drew "Happy Birthday" for you on the blackboard. Or beyond all imaginations, it was when I invited you to "crash" at my place. I just know everything from us sharing the corner seats in library to spanking butts and kissing on the stairs when no one was watching led to this. This blissful paradise that I am in and I get to breathe every living day. <br><br>
        You are amazing. There is no question about it, ofcourse but YOU. ARE. AMAZING. Such purity, such beauty, such aroma (yes, aroma) and such is your aura that this world is no match for your wonders. An Angel, in every sense of the word. My Little Angel &#128538;. How can I ever stop worshipping you? You are such a marvel, a one-time creation that is no less than a divine phenomenon. <br><br>A Merry 20th Birthday, my Love. Congratulations, as I would say for entering the 20s. This is where the fun begins. I wish the absolute best of the best for you. Keep at your goals with resilience and patience. Take rest when you need it and take care of yourself, for me. Good stuff will come your way. They were made for you after all. As I have been and always will be, I am with you for everything and anything. You have my whole heart as I am yours and I LOVE this privilege to call you mine. <br><br>Many Many Many Returns of the Day, My Cheetos &#x1F9E1; <br><br><br>(Psst. I did see her, yes. And I love her. A gracious birthday anniversary to her as well, special wishes from him &#128536;)</p>
